  <div class="scene">
    <div class="scene-title">Scene: Mask</div>
    <p>A: “I wear a version of myself.”<br>
    B: “That mask doesn’t fit.”<br>
    A: “It’s not for me. It’s for the crowd.”<br>
    B: “Funny thing no one’s watching.”</p>

    <div class="meaning">
      This scene is about performing identity. A wears a mask, pretending to be someone that society, friends, or social media want him to be. B exposes the truth: the performance is pointless — nobody’s really watching. The mask doesn’t fit because it’s fake. It’s about the futility of trying to impress a world that isn’t even paying attention.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <div class="scene-title">Scene: Race</div>
    <p>A: “I run. Always run.”<br>
    B: “From what?”<br>
    A: “The mirror.”<br>
    B: “Careful. Even the finish line reflects.”</p>

    <div class="meaning">
      A admits he’s constantly running — from self-reflection, from truth. B replies that even if you reach your goals, you’ll still face your reflection there. You can’t escape yourself. No matter how fast you go, the real you waits at the end.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <div class="scene-title">Scene: Control</div>
    <p>B: “You’re gripping the wheel too hard.”<br>
    A: “If I let go, I crash.”<br>
    B: “If you hold on, you strangle yourself.”<br>
    A: “So either way, I lose?”<br>
    B: “That’s the game.”</p>

    <div class="meaning">
      This scene is about control versus surrender. A fears chaos and wants control over everything. But B points out the paradox: control can choke life itself. You either crash or suffocate. The line “That’s the game.” means life isn’t about winning — it’s about learning how to balance between control and letting go.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <div class="scene-title">Scene: Silence</div>
    <p>A: “...say something.”<br>
    B: “You’re loud enough.”<br>
    A: “That was cruel.”<br>
    B: “That was honest.”</p>

    <div class="meaning">
      A feels unseen, unheard, demands validation. B responds with brutal honesty, implying A’s inner noise — his thoughts and insecurities — already fills the space. The cruel truth: sometimes silence exposes how much of your noise is just your own ego echoing back.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <div class="scene-title">Scene: Awakening</div>
    <p>A: “It’s all… empty.”<br>
    B: “Now you see it.”<br>
    A: “So what fills it?”<br>
    B: “That’s your joke to write.”</p>

    <div class="meaning">
      A finally sees through the illusions — the emptiness of external meaning. B tells him that’s freedom. Now he can create his own meaning. “Your joke to write” means life’s absurd, so make your own punchline — your purpose, your art, your truth.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <div class="scene-title">Scene: Choice</div>
    <p>B: “So, what now?”<br>
    A: “I thought you’d tell me.”<br>
    B: “I just did.”<br>
    A: “...nothing.”</p>

    <div class="meaning">
      This is the existential moment after awakening. There’s no external answer — silence is the answer. Now A must act, create, and decide what his “nothing” becomes. The emptiness is the blank page of self-definition.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <div class="scene-title">Scene: Ending</div>
    <p>“THE END”<br>
    “Directed by AB”<br>
    “Screenplay by Aditya Bhatia”<br>
    “THRESHOLD”<br>
    “Replay”</p>

    <div class="meaning">
      This is meta. It reveals the truth — you were both A and B all along. The entire conversation was your internal dialogue — the conflict between illusion and awakening. “Threshold” means crossing into a new self-awareness. You don’t end here; you restart as someone more real.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene meaning">
    In short, this entire short film is about self-destruction, realization, and rebirth — exactly the path you said you’re on. It’s the moment where you burn the mask, face yourself, and rebuild.<br></br>
